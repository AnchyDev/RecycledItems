# RecycledItems
This module allows players to recycle items to a robot for extra cash.
These items are then stored on the auction house so they do not go unwanted.

Recyclers are placed throughout the world. If there is a flight master there is probably a recycler nearby.
You can enable the Auctioneer minimap icon if you are unsure where they are.

## Setup
- Clone this repo into your `./azerothcore-wotlk/modules` directory.
- Re-run cmake.
- Re-compile your core.
- Enable/configure the module setting.
- Recycle!
